When surfaces are nested, <code>Escape</code> closes them one level at a time.</li><li><strong>Outside interaction</strong> — a pointer press outside the surface closes it. A surface that models an irreversible decision (an alert dialog) may opt out of outside-dismiss so a stray click can't discard the choice.</li><li><strong>Explicit affordance</strong> — a visible close control (or a menu item that performs its action) dismisses the surface.</li><li><strong>Clean teardown</strong> — on close, any transient state is discarded and focus is returned to a sensible place (see the focus-trap trait for modal surfaces).</li></ul>\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\n<ul><li>The dismiss keys must not be swallowed by inner controls; <code>Escape</code> reaches the surface even when a field inside it is focused.</li><li>Auto-dismissing surfaces (toasts) must give enough time and a way to pause or re-summon the content, and must not be the only channel for critical messages.</li></ul>\n<h2>Notes for implementers</h2>\n<p>Dismissal is a behavior, not a visual style.
