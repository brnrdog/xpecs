# Switch

## Intent

A switch turns a single setting on or off, taking effect immediately like a
physical light switch. Its value is the instant, self-evident nature of the
change — no separate submit step.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": false,
    "minTarget": "44px",
    "reflow": []
  },
  "props": [
    {"name":"checked","type":"boolean","default":"false","description":"On/off state."},
    {"name":"disabled","type":"boolean","default":"false","description":"Not interactive."},
    {"name":"label","type":"string","default":"","description":"Names what the switch toggles."}
  ],
  "events": ["onChange"],
  "a11y": {"role":"switch","keyboard":["Space","Enter"],"announces":["checked","disabled"]},
  "states": ["off","on","focus-visible","disabled"],
  "tokens": ["color.action.*","radius.full"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Toggling a binary setting that applies right away (notifications on/off).

**Avoid when**
- The choice is part of a form applied on submit — use a **checkbox**.
- More than two states are possible — use a **radio-group** or **select**.

## Anatomy

- **Track** (required) — the on/off channel.
- **Thumb** (required) — slides between positions.
- **Label** (required) — names the setting.
- **State text** (optional) — explicit on/off wording.

## States & behavior

- **Off / on** — toggled on activation, effect applied immediately.
- **Disabled** — not interactive.
- **Pending** (optional) — brief in-flight state if the change is async, with
  rollback on failure.

## Variants

- **With inline label** — label beside the switch.
- **With description** — supporting text under the label.

## Layout & responsiveness

The switch aligns to its label on a shared baseline, commonly with the switch at
the trailing edge of a settings row. The whole row can be the target.

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard** — focusable; `Space`/`Enter` toggles.
- **Semantics** — switch role with on/off state, or a checkbox exposing the same.
- **Screen reader** — announces label and on/off state.
- **Focus** — visible focus indicator.

## Content guidelines

- Label the setting, not the action ("Email notifications", not "Enable").
- Avoid relying on the thumb position alone; expose state to assistive tech.

## Composition

**Composed of:** label.

**Used by:** form, field, settings, sidebar.

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Use for instantly-applied binary settings.
- Reflect async success/failure honestly.

**Don't**
- Use a switch where a submit step is expected.
- Depend on color alone to show on/off.
