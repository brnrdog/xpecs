# Typography

## Intent

Typography is the shared set of text styles — headings, body copy, lists, quotes,
code, and inline emphasis — that gives written content clear hierarchy and
comfortable reading rhythm. It is the connective tissue of nearly every screen;
consistent type is what makes an interface feel coherent.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": true,
    "reflow": [
      {
        "pattern": "fluid",
        "note": "the measure adapts; long words break to avoid overflow"
      }
    ]
  },
  "props": [
    {"name":"variant","type":"enum","values":["h1","h2","h3","h4","body","small","muted","code"],"default":"body","description":"Semantic/visual role."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"text","required":true,"description":"The textual content."}
  ],
  "a11y": {"announces":["heading level"]},
  "states": ["default"],
  "tokens": ["font.family.sans","font.weight.*","font.size.*","color.neutral.*"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Presenting any textual content that needs hierarchy and legibility.
- Rendering long-form or authored prose ("rich text") consistently.

**Avoid when**
- A value is really a control's label or a status — use **label** or **badge**.

## Anatomy

- **Headings** (required) — a ranked scale (page title down through subsections).
- **Body text** (required) — default reading style with comfortable measure.
- **Inline elements** (optional) — emphasis, strong, links, inline code.
- **Blocks** (optional) — lists, blockquotes, code blocks, captions.
- **Lead / muted** (optional) — intro and secondary text treatments.

## States & behavior

Mostly static. Links carry interactive states; truncated text may reveal full
content on interaction. Text reflows with container width.

## Variants

- **Display / heading scale** — for titles and section headers.
- **Body / lead / small / muted** — reading and secondary styles.
- **Prose block** — a styled container for authored rich text.

## Layout & responsiveness

Constrain body text to a readable measure (line length) and maintain a consistent
vertical rhythm between elements. Scale headings responsively so hierarchy holds
on small and large screens without overwhelming the layout.

## Accessibility

- **Structure** — headings follow a logical, non-skipping order and convey real
  document structure, not just visual size.
- **Readability** — sufficient text contrast and a minimum comfortable size;
  respect user font-size and zoom.
- **Semantics** — emphasis, lists, quotes, and code use meaningful markup, not
  styling alone.

## Content guidelines

- Use one page title; nest subheadings by meaning, not appearance.
- Keep line length readable; avoid overly long measures.
- Reserve emphasis for genuine emphasis.

## Composition

**Composed of:** Not applicable — a foundational element used throughout.

**Used by:** card, landing-page, dialog, form, and essentially every archetype
containing text.

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Map visual scale to semantic structure.
- Maintain consistent rhythm and readable measure.

**Don't**
- Choose heading levels for size instead of hierarchy.
- Convey meaning through styling alone.
