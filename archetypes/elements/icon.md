# Icon

## Intent

An icon is a small symbol that conveys a concept at a glance — a magnifier for
search, a trash can for delete — or reinforces a text label. Used well, icons speed
recognition and save space; used carelessly, they become decoration that assistive
technology and unfamiliar users can't interpret. Meaning, not ornament, is the bar.

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Reinforcing a label, or marking a well-understood action/status compactly.

**Avoid when**
- The concept isn't reliably recognizable as a symbol — use text.
- The icon is the sole carrier of meaning without an accessible name.

## Anatomy

- **Glyph** (required) — the symbol itself, on a consistent grid and weight.
- **Bounding box** (required) — a consistent optical size for alignment.
- **Accessible name** (conditional) — required when the icon conveys meaning on its
  own; omitted (and hidden) when purely decorative beside a label.

## States & behavior

- **Decorative** — accompanies text; hidden from assistive tech.
- **Meaningful** — conveys standalone meaning; carries a text alternative.
- **Inherited styling** — typically takes color and size from surrounding text.

## Variants

- **Outline vs. solid** — a consistent style set.
- **Sizes** — from an optical size scale.
- **Standalone vs. inline** — beside text or on its own.

## Layout & responsiveness

Icons align optically with adjacent text (baseline and size) and scale from a
defined size set. Keep one style family across a product so the visual language
stays coherent.

## Accessibility

- **Decorative icons** — hidden from assistive tech so they aren't announced.
- **Meaningful icons** — provide a text alternative/accessible name describing the
  concept, not the picture.
- **Contrast** — meaningful icons meet non-text contrast against their background.
- **Not sole meaning** — never rely on an icon alone where the meaning must be
  understood; pair with text or a name.

## Content guidelines

- Use conventional metaphors; keep one icon meaning consistent across the product.
- Name meaningful icons by concept ("Search"), not appearance ("Magnifier").

## Composition

**Composed of:** Not applicable — a primitive display element.

**Used by:** button, icon-button, feature-grid, alert, badge, list, stat.

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Keep a single, consistent icon style and grid.
- Give meaningful icons accessible names; hide decorative ones.

**Don't**
- Rely on an unfamiliar icon without a label.
- Mix icon styles within a product.
