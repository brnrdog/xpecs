# Carousel

## Intent

A carousel presents a sequence of items — images, cards, testimonials — in a
horizontally scrollable track, showing a subset at a time with controls to move
through them. It suits browsable, non-essential content where saving vertical
space matters more than seeing everything at once.

## API

```json
{
  "props": [
    {"name":"orientation","type":"enum","values":["horizontal","vertical"],"default":"horizontal","description":"Scroll axis."},
    {"name":"loop","type":"boolean","default":"false","description":"Wrap from last to first."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"slide","required":true},
    {"name":"controls","required":false}
  ],
  "events": ["onSelect"],
  "a11y": {"role":"group","keyboard":["ArrowLeft","ArrowRight"],"announces":["slide x of n"]},
  "states": ["default","dragging"],
  "tokens": ["radius.md","color.neutral.*"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Showcasing a browsable set (gallery, featured items) where order is loose.
- Vertical space is constrained and users can page through content.

**Avoid when**
- Content is important and must not be missed — carousels hide items and lower
  engagement with later slides. Prefer a grid or list.
- Items are navigational sections — use **tabs**.

## Anatomy

- **Viewport & track** (required) — the clipped area and the moving row of slides.
- **Slides** (required) — the items, one or several visible.
- **Previous/next controls** (required) — move by item or page.
- **Pagination indicators** (optional) — position dots.
- **Autoplay controls** (conditional) — pause/play when autoplay exists.

## States & behavior

- **At start / middle / end** — controls disable or loop at bounds.
- **Dragging / swiping** — pointer and touch scrolling with snapping.
- **Autoplay** (optional) — advances on a timer; must be pausable and stop on
  interaction/hover/focus.

Keyboard moves between slides; focus stays visible as slides change.

## Variants

- **Single-item** — one slide at a time.
- **Multi-item** — several visible, paging by group.
- **With/without autoplay**; **looping vs. bounded**.

## Layout & responsiveness

Slides size to the viewport, showing fewer per view as width shrinks. Snap points
keep slides aligned. Ensure controls remain reachable and don't obscure content.

## Accessibility

- **Semantics** — a labeled group/region conveying it's a carousel with multiple
  slides and current position.
- **Keyboard** — controls are focusable and operable; off-screen slides don't trap
  focus.
- **Autoplay** — provide an accessible pause; never autoplay motion without one,
  and respect reduced-motion.
- **Screen reader** — announces slide position ("3 of 8") and updates on change.

## Content guidelines

- Don't bury critical content on later slides.
- Label controls clearly ("Previous slide"/"Next slide").

## Composition

**Composed of:** button (controls), card / aspect-ratio (slides).

**Used by:** landing-page, dashboard.

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Provide manual controls and pause autoplay on interaction.
- Indicate position and total.

**Don't**
- Put essential content or primary CTAs only inside a carousel.
- Autoplay motion without a way to stop it.
