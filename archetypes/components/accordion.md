# Accordion

## Intent

An accordion organizes related content into collapsible sections so users can
scan headers and expand only what they need. It reduces long pages to a
manageable overview and is a natural fit for FAQs and grouped settings.

## API

```json
{
  "props": [
    {"name":"type","type":"enum","values":["single","multiple"],"default":"single","description":"One panel open at a time, or many."},
    {"name":"collapsible","type":"boolean","default":"true","description":"Whether the open panel can be closed again."},
    {"name":"value","type":"string","default":"","description":"id(s) of the open item(s)."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"item","required":true,"description":"A header + collapsible panel pair."}
  ],
  "events": ["onChange"],
  "a11y": {"keyboard":["Enter","Space","ArrowUp","ArrowDown"],"announces":["expanded"]},
  "states": ["collapsed","expanded","focus-visible","disabled"],
  "tokens": ["color.neutral.*","radius.md"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Content divides into labeled sections and users need only some at a time.
- Vertical space is limited and progressive disclosure helps scanning.

**Avoid when**
- Users need to compare sections side by side — use **tabs** or show all.
- There is a single collapsible region — use a **collapsible**.

## Anatomy

- **Items** (required) — each a header plus a collapsible panel.
- **Header/trigger** (required) — labels the section and toggles it; shows an
  expanded/collapsed affordance.
- **Panel** (required) — the revealed content.
- **Dividers** (optional) — separate items.

## States & behavior

- **Collapsed / expanded** — per item, toggled by the header.
- **Single vs. multiple open** — either one item at a time or several.
- **Disabled** — an item that can't be opened.

Expanding animates height; the header reflects state.

## Variants

- **Single-open** — opening one closes the others.
- **Multi-open** — any number expanded.
- **Bordered / flush** — visual framing options.

## Layout & responsiveness

Items stack full-width; panels push content below rather than overlaying it.
Works well on small screens as a space-saving disclosure. Avoid layout jumps by
animating height smoothly.

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard** — headers are focusable and toggle on `Enter`/`Space`; arrow keys
  may move between headers.
- **Semantics** — each header is a button controlling its panel, exposing
  expanded/collapsed and the relationship to the panel.
- **Screen reader** — announces the header, state, and that it controls a region.
- **Focus** — visible focus on headers.

## Content guidelines

- Write headers as concise, scannable labels or questions.
- Keep panel content self-contained.

## Composition

**Composed of:** collapsible (per item), separator.

**Used by:** landing-page (FAQ), settings, sidebar.

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Let users open multiple sections when comparison helps.
- Keep headers descriptive and consistent.

**Don't**
- Hide critical content that everyone needs behind a collapse.
- Nest accordions deeply.
