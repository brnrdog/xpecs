# Form

## Intent

A form gathers structured input from a user, validates it, and submits it to
accomplish a goal — signing in, creating a record, updating settings. It
orchestrates fields, guidance, validation, and submission into one coherent,
accessible flow, minimizing effort and error.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": true,
    "minTarget": "44px",
    "reflow": [
      {
        "at": "md",
        "pattern": "stack",
        "note": "multi-column field rows collapse to a single column"
      }
    ]
  },
  "props": [],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"fields","required":true},
    {"name":"validation","required":true},
    {"name":"actions","required":true}
  ],
  "events": ["onSubmit"],
  "a11y": {"announces":["errors","submitting"]},
  "states": ["default","submitting","success","error"],
  "tokens": ["color.action.*"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Collecting one or more related values the user reviews and submits.

**Avoid when**
- A single setting applies instantly — a lone **switch** may be enough.
- The interaction is a search box — that's a single input, not a form flow.

## Anatomy

- **Fields** (required) — label + control + help/error (the field archetype).
- **Groups / sections / fieldsets** (optional) — related fields with a legend.
- **Guidance** (optional) — instructions and required-field conventions.
- **Validation feedback** (required) — inline per-field and a summary for errors.
- **Actions** (required) — submit plus optional cancel/reset.
- **Status** (required) — submitting, success, and error states.

## States & behavior

- **Editing** — users enter values; validate at sensible times (blur/submit).
- **Invalid** — inline messages plus an error summary; focus moves to the first
  error on submit.
- **Submitting** — controls disabled or the submit shows progress; prevent double
  submit.
- **Success / error** — clear outcome, preserving input on failure.
- **Dirty** — warn before discarding unsaved changes.

## Variants

- **Single-column** — the recommended default for scannability.
- **Sectioned / multi-step (wizard)** — long forms split into steps with progress.
- **Inline / compact** — short forms (login, search-adjacent).

## Layout & responsiveness

Prefer a single column with a comfortable measure and consistent vertical rhythm;
labels above controls. Group related fields; keep the primary action prominent and
predictably placed. On small screens, fields go full-width.

## Accessibility

- **Semantics** — a form landmark; each control labeled; groups use fieldset/legend.
- **Validation** — errors are programmatically associated with fields, announced,
  and summarized; focus moves to the first error on submit.
- **Keyboard** — logical tab order; submit reachable; Enter submits where expected.
- **Status** — submitting/success/error conveyed via live regions, not color alone.

## Content guidelines

- Ask only for what's needed; explain why for sensitive fields.
- Write specific, actionable error messages; mark required consistently.
- Label the submit with its outcome ("Create account"), not "Submit".

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"field","slot":"fields","note":"each label + control + message"},
    {"ref":"input","slot":"fields"},
    {"ref":"textarea","slot":"fields"},
    {"ref":"select","slot":"fields"},
    {"ref":"checkbox","slot":"fields"},
    {"ref":"radio-group","slot":"fields"},
    {"ref":"switch","slot":"fields"},
    {"ref":"alert","slot":"validation","note":"error summary"},
    {"ref":"button","slot":"actions","props":{"type":"submit","variant":"primary"}}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Validate helpfully and preserve input on error.
- Prevent duplicate submissions and confirm success.

**Don't**
- Clear the form on a failed submit.
- Rely on placeholders as labels or color alone for errors.
