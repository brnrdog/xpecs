# Dialog

## Intent

A dialog overlays the page to give a focused, self-contained space for a task or
content — a form, details, a confirmation with body content — while dimming and
disabling the rest of the interface. It concentrates attention without navigating
away, then returns the user exactly where they were.

## API

```json
{
  "props": [
    {"name":"open","type":"boolean","default":"false","description":"Whether the dialog is shown."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"header","required":true},
    {"name":"body","required":true},
    {"name":"footer","required":false}
  ],
  "events": ["onOpenChange"],
  "a11y": {"role":"dialog","keyboard":["Tab","Escape"],"announces":["name"]},
  "states": ["closed","open"],
  "tokens": ["color.neutral.*","radius.lg"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- A focused subtask benefits from isolating the user from the page (edit, create,
  view details).
- The user should complete or dismiss before returning to context.

**Avoid when**
- It merely confirms a risky action — use an **alert-dialog**.
- The content is large or navigational — consider a **sheet**/**drawer** or a page.
- Only a small contextual overlay is needed — use a **popover**.

## Anatomy

- **Overlay / scrim** (required) — dims and blocks the background.
- **Container / panel** (required) — the focused surface.
- **Header** (required) — title and close control.
- **Body** (required) — content, scrollable if long.
- **Footer** (optional) — primary and secondary actions.

## States & behavior

- **Open / closed** — modal; the background is inert while open.
- **Scrolling** — long bodies scroll within the panel, keeping header/footer visible.
- **Pending** — actions can show progress.
- **Dismiss** — via close, `Escape`, or scrim click (unless work would be lost).

## Variants

- **Modal** — blocks interaction (default).
- **Non-modal** (rare) — background remains usable.
- **Scrollable / fixed-footer** — for long content.

## Layout & responsiveness

A centered, size-constrained panel over a scrim. On small screens it may go
full-screen or become a sheet. Long content scrolls in the body while the title
and actions stay reachable.

## Accessibility

- **Semantics** — a dialog with its title as accessible name (and body described
  where useful).
- **Keyboard** — focus moves into the dialog on open, is trapped while open, and
  returns to the trigger on close; `Escape` closes.
- **Screen reader** — announces the dialog and its purpose on open.
- **Background** — content behind is inert and hidden from assistive tech.

## Content guidelines

- Title names the task; keep the body focused on one job.
- Use specific action verbs; place the primary action consistently.

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"scroll-area","slot":"body","note":"scrolls long content"},
    {"ref":"separator","slot":"footer","note":"divides body and actions"},
    {"ref":"button","slot":"footer","props":{"variant":"primary"}}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Trap and restore focus; support `Escape`.
- Keep dialogs focused on a single task.

**Don't**
- Stack dialogs on dialogs.
- Discard unsaved work on an accidental scrim click without warning.
