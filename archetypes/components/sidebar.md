# Sidebar

## Intent

A sidebar provides persistent, vertically-organized navigation beside an
application's content, scaling to many sections and nested groups. It's the primary
wayfinding surface for product/app shells where a horizontal navbar would run out
of room, keeping destinations always visible or a click away.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": false,
    "minTarget": "44px",
    "reflow": [
      {
        "at": "lg",
        "pattern": "drawer",
        "note": "the rail becomes a toggled off-canvas drawer"
      }
    ]
  },
  "props": [
    {"name":"collapsed","type":"boolean","default":"false","description":"Whether the rail is collapsed."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"header","required":false},
    {"name":"nav","required":true},
    {"name":"footer","required":false}
  ],
  "a11y": {"role":"navigation","keyboard":["ArrowUp","ArrowDown"],"announces":["current section"]},
  "states": ["expanded","collapsed"],
  "tokens": ["color.neutral.*"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- An application has many sections or nested navigation that needs to stay present.
- Vertical space for grouped, scrollable navigation suits the product.

**Avoid when**
- Navigation is a few marketing links — use a **navbar**.
- The panel is a transient task surface — use a **sheet**/**drawer**.

## Anatomy

- **Container / rail** (required) — the persistent vertical region.
- **Brand / header** (optional) — logo or workspace switcher.
- **Navigation groups** (required) — sections with items, optionally collapsible.
- **Nav items** (required) — links with icons, labels, and optional badges.
- **Active indicator** (required) — current destination.
- **Footer** (optional) — account, settings, collapse control.
- **Collapse toggle** (optional) — expand/collapse to an icon rail.

## States & behavior

- **Expanded / collapsed (rail)** — full labels vs. icons only, with tooltips when
  collapsed.
- **Group expand/collapse** — nested sections toggle.
- **Active item** — current location marked.
- **Mobile** — becomes an off-canvas drawer behind a toggle.

## Variants

- **Full sidebar** — icons + labels.
- **Icon rail** — compact, icon-only with tooltips.
- **Multi-level** — nested collapsible groups.
- **Dual (rail + panel)** — a slim rail plus a contextual panel.

## Layout & responsiveness

Fixed to a side, full height, with a scrollable navigation region and pinned
header/footer. It collapses to a rail on medium widths and to an off-canvas drawer
on small screens. Content area adjusts to the sidebar's width.

## Accessibility

- **Semantics** — a navigation landmark with an accessible name; current item
  marked; collapsible groups expose expanded state.
- **Keyboard** — all items and toggles reachable and operable; logical order.
- **Screen reader** — announces the landmark, groups, items, and current location;
  collapsed-rail items retain accessible names.
- **Focus** — visible focus; when it becomes a drawer, focus is managed and trapped.

## Content guidelines

- Group destinations meaningfully with short, distinct labels.
- Keep icons paired with labels; ensure collapsed icons have names.

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"link","slot":"nav"},
    {"ref":"button","slot":"nav"},
    {"ref":"collapsible","slot":"nav","note":"nav groups"},
    {"ref":"avatar","slot":"footer"},
    {"ref":"separator","slot":"nav"},
    {"ref":"badge","slot":"nav","note":"counts"},
    {"ref":"scroll-area","slot":"nav"}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Keep the current location obvious and navigation scannable.
- Provide accessible names for collapsed icon items.

**Don't**
- Cram every action into the sidebar.
- Lose current-location context when collapsed.
