# Menubar

## Intent

A menubar presents an application's commands as a persistent horizontal row of
top-level menus (File, Edit, View…), each opening a list of grouped actions. It
mirrors the desktop-application menu model, giving power users a comprehensive,
predictable home for commands.

## API

```json
{
  "props": [],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"menu","required":true},
    {"name":"item","required":true}
  ],
  "events": ["onSelect"],
  "a11y": {"role":"menubar","keyboard":["ArrowLeft","ArrowRight","ArrowDown","Enter","Escape"],"announces":["active item"]},
  "states": ["default","open"],
  "tokens": ["color.neutral.*","radius.md"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Building an application-like product with many grouped commands.
- Users expect a desktop-style, always-available command surface.

**Avoid when**
- The product is content/marketing-oriented — use a **navbar** or
  **navigation-menu**.
- There are only a few actions — a **dropdown-menu** suffices.

## Anatomy

- **Bar** (required) — the horizontal container of menu triggers.
- **Top-level menus** (required) — each a labeled trigger opening a menu.
- **Menu items** (required) — actions, with icons, shortcuts, and submenus.
- **Separators & groups** (optional).
- **Checkable items** (optional) — toggles and single-choice groups.

## States & behavior

- **Idle** — no menu open.
- **Menu open** — one menu at a time; moving across the bar switches menus.
- **Submenu open** — on hover/arrow.
- **Dismiss** — `Escape`, selection, or outside click.

Roving focus moves across the bar; arrows enter and traverse menus.

## Variants

- **Full menubar** — many top-level menus.
- **Compact** — a couple of menus for lighter apps.

## Layout & responsiveness

A single horizontal row of triggers with menus opening below. On narrow widths,
collapse into an overflow or a single menu button. Keep the bar's position stable.

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard** — left/right move across the bar, down opens a menu, up/down within
  it, submenus via right, Esc closes; a single tab stop for the bar.
- **Semantics** — a menubar with menuitem/menu roles, exposing submenu, checked,
  and disabled states.
- **Screen reader** — announces the bar, menus, items, and state.
- **Focus** — roving focus with a visible indicator.

## Content guidelines

- Use conventional menu names and ordering where they exist.
- Show shortcuts; mark destructive items.

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"dropdown-menu","slot":"menu"},
    {"ref":"separator","slot":"item"},
    {"ref":"kbd","slot":"item","note":"shortcut hints"}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Follow established menubar keyboard conventions.
- Keep top-level groupings meaningful.

**Don't**
- Use a menubar for simple marketing navigation.
- Overload menus with deep nesting.
