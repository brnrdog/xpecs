# Combobox

## Intent

A combobox combines a text input with a dynamically filtered list, letting users
either type to narrow options or browse and pick one. It scales selection to large
option sets where a plain select would be unwieldy, and supports free-form entry
when allowed.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": true,
    "minTarget": "44px",
    "reflow": [
      {
        "pattern": "fluid",
        "note": "the input fills its field"
      },
      {
        "pattern": "reposition",
        "note": "the popover flips to stay in view"
      },
      {
        "at": "sm",
        "pattern": "to-sheet",
        "note": "the option list can present as a bottom sheet"
      }
    ]
  },
  "props": [
    {"name":"value","type":"string","default":"","description":"Selected value."},
    {"name":"disabled","type":"boolean","default":"false"}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"input","required":true},
    {"name":"option","required":true},
    {"name":"empty","required":false},
    {"name":"surface","required":false,"description":""}
  ],
  "events": ["onChange","onInput"],
  "a11y": {"role":"combobox","keyboard":["ArrowDown","ArrowUp","Enter","Escape"],"announces":["expanded","active option"]},
  "states": ["closed","open","loading","empty","disabled"],
  "tokens": ["color.action.*","radius.md"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Choosing from many options where typing to filter helps.
- You want search + selection in one control, optionally allowing new values.

**Avoid when**
- The option set is small and fixed — a **select** or **radio-group** is simpler.
- You're issuing commands, not picking a value — use **command**.

## Anatomy

- **Text input** (required) — accepts the query.
- **Toggle / trigger** (optional) — opens the list without typing.
- **Popover list** (required) — filtered options in a scrollable region.
- **Options** (required) — selectable items, possibly grouped, with highlight of
  the query match.
- **Selected indicator / tokens** (conditional) — check for single, chips for multi.
- **Empty & loading states** (required) — "no results" and async loading.

## States & behavior

- **Closed / open** — list toggled by typing, click, or keyboard.
- **Filtering** — options narrow to the query; async sources show loading.
- **Highlighted option** — moves with arrow keys independent of focus.
- **Selection** — single (fills the input) or multiple (chips), clearable.
- **No results** — explicit empty state, optionally offering to create the value.

## Variants

- **Single / multi-select**.
- **Free-solo** — allows values not in the list.
- **Async** — options fetched as the user types.

## Layout & responsiveness

The input anchors a popover list sized to the trigger, flipping when space is
tight. On small screens the list may present as a full-height sheet. The list
scrolls; the selected/highlighted item stays in view.

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard** — type to filter; arrows move the highlight; Enter selects; Esc
  closes; Home/End jump.
- **Semantics** — a combobox exposing expanded state, the controlled listbox, and
  the active option; selection state per option.
- **Screen reader** — announces the active option, result counts, and selection.
- **Focus** — focus stays in the input; visible highlight tracks the active option.

## Content guidelines

- Placeholder hints the action ("Search framework…").
- Provide a helpful empty state and, if allowed, a "create" affordance.

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"input","slot":"input"},
    {"ref":"popover","slot":"surface"},
    {"ref":"scroll-area","slot":"option","note":"long lists"},
    {"ref":"badge","slot":"input","note":"multi-select tokens"}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Support keyboard filtering and selection fully.
- Show clear loading and empty states.

**Don't**
- Use a combobox for a handful of fixed options.
- Lose the user's query or selection on reopen.
