# Collapsible

## Intent

A collapsible is a single show/hide region controlled by a trigger. It defers
secondary detail until the user asks for it — a "show more", an optional form
section, an expandable row of detail — keeping the default view clean.

## API

```json
{
  "props": [
    {"name":"open","type":"boolean","default":"false","description":"Whether the region is expanded."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"trigger","required":true},
    {"name":"content","required":true}
  ],
  "events": ["onToggle"],
  "a11y": {"keyboard":["Enter","Space"],"announces":["expanded"]},
  "states": ["collapsed","expanded"],
  "tokens": ["color.neutral.*"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- One region of content is optional or secondary and can be hidden by default.
- You want a lightweight "show more / show less" toggle.

**Avoid when**
- There are several sibling sections to expand — use an **accordion**.
- Hidden content overlays rather than pushes — use a **popover**.

## Anatomy

- **Trigger** (required) — toggles the region and shows expanded/collapsed state.
- **Content region** (required) — revealed or hidden.

## States & behavior

- **Collapsed / expanded** — toggled by the trigger.
- **Disabled** — cannot be toggled.

Expansion animates height and pushes surrounding content rather than overlaying.

## Variants

- **Inline "show more"** — for truncated text.
- **Sectioned** — an optional block within a form or panel.

## Layout & responsiveness

Content flows in the document, moving what follows. Keep the trigger's target
adequate and the expand/collapse motion smooth to avoid jumps.

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard** — trigger is focusable and toggles on `Enter`/`Space`.
- **Semantics** — the trigger exposes expanded/collapsed and controls the region.
- **Screen reader** — announces state and the relationship to the content.
- **Focus** — visible focus on the trigger.

## Content guidelines

- Label the trigger by what it reveals ("Show advanced options").
- Keep the collapsed state informative enough to decide whether to expand.

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"button","slot":"trigger"}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Make the trigger's state and target obvious.
- Use it for genuinely secondary content.

**Don't**
- Hide essential content everyone needs.
- Use a single collapsible where an accordion of peers is meant.
