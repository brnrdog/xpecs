# Input Group

## Intent

An input group binds an input with adjacent add-ons — a prefix/suffix, an icon, a
unit, a select, or a button — into one composite control. It gives the value
context (currency symbol, protocol, unit) or an attached action (search, copy,
apply) while reading as a single, cohesive field.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": true,
    "minTarget": "44px",
    "reflow": [
      {
        "pattern": "fluid",
        "note": "the field fills; addons keep their size"
      },
      {
        "at": "sm",
        "pattern": "wrap",
        "note": "addons may wrap below the field"
      }
    ]
  },
  "props": [],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"addon","required":false},
    {"name":"input","required":true}
  ],
  "states": ["default","focus-visible","disabled"],
  "tokens": ["color.neutral.*","radius.md"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- An input needs a fixed affix (unit, symbol, domain) or an attached action/select.
- Combining input + button (search, apply) into one visual control.

**Avoid when**
- The affix is guidance, not part of the value — use helper text instead.
- Multiple independent fields are involved — use separate fields.

## Anatomy

- **Input** (required) — the editable value.
- **Leading add-on** (optional) — icon, symbol, prefix text, or select.
- **Trailing add-on** (optional) — unit, action button, or select.
- **Validation message** (conditional) — for the composite value.

## States & behavior

- **Focus-within** — the whole group reflects focus on the input.
- **Add-on actions** — attached buttons trigger actions (search, clear, apply,
  copy); attached selects change a related parameter (unit, protocol).
- **Disabled / invalid** — applied consistently across the group.

## Variants

- **Prefix/suffix text** — symbols or units.
- **With icon** — leading/trailing icon.
- **With button** — attached action.
- **With select** — an attached choice affecting the input's meaning.

## Layout & responsiveness

Add-ons sit flush against the input with shared borders and rounded outer corners,
forming one control. On narrow widths, ensure attached controls stay tappable;
consider stacking only if the seam would break. Keep the input the dominant target.

## Accessibility

- **Associations** — the group has one accessible name for the value; affixes that
  change meaning (e.g. unit select) are exposed, not just visual.
- **Keyboard** — the input and any attached controls are each focusable and operable.
- **Screen reader** — announces the value with meaningful affixes and the purpose of
  attached actions.
- **Focus** — visible focus on the focused member; adequate target sizes.

## Content guidelines

- Use affixes that are genuinely part of the value; keep them short.
- Label attached buttons/selects by their action or parameter.

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"input","slot":"input"},
    {"ref":"button","slot":"addon"},
    {"ref":"select","slot":"addon"},
    {"ref":"badge","slot":"addon"}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Keep the composite readable as one control with one value name.
- Ensure attached controls are individually operable.

**Don't**
- Stuff unrelated fields into one group.
- Hide meaningful affixes from assistive tech.
