# Breadcrumb

## Intent

A breadcrumb shows where the current page sits within a hierarchy and offers a
one-click path back to any ancestor. It answers "where am I and how do I get
back," reinforcing structure in deep or nested products.

## API

```json
{
  "props": [
    {"name":"separator","type":"string","default":"/","description":"Glyph between crumbs."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"item","required":true,"description":"A link to an ancestor; the last is the current page."}
  ],
  "a11y": {"role":"navigation","announces":["current page"]},
  "states": ["default"],
  "tokens": ["color.neutral.*"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Content is hierarchical and users navigate several levels deep.
- Users benefit from seeing and jumping to ancestor levels.

**Avoid when**
- The site is flat or the hierarchy is shallow — breadcrumbs add little.
- The list represents peers, not ancestry — use **tabs** or nav.

## Anatomy

- **Items** (required) — ancestor links from root to parent.
- **Separators** (required) — between items.
- **Current page** (required) — the last item, non-linking.
- **Overflow menu** (optional) — collapses middle levels when the trail is long.

## States & behavior

- **Default** — ancestors are links; the current item is inert.
- **Overflow** — middle items collapse into a menu on narrow widths.
- **Hover/focus** — standard link states on ancestors.

## Variants

- **Full trail** — all levels shown.
- **Collapsed** — root + overflow + current.
- **With icons** — small icons per level.

## Layout & responsiveness

A single horizontal line reading root → current. When it exceeds available width,
collapse middle items behind an overflow control rather than wrapping or
truncating the current item. Keep the current page always visible.

## Accessibility

- **Semantics** — a navigation landmark labeled as breadcrumb; the current item is
  marked as current.
- **Keyboard** — all links reachable and operable in order.
- **Screen reader** — announces the trail and current location.
- **Separators** — decorative separators are not announced as content.

## Content guidelines

- Use the same titles as the destinations.
- Keep labels short; the current page matches the page title.

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"link","slot":"item"},
    {"ref":"separator","slot":"item","note":"between crumbs"},
    {"ref":"dropdown-menu","slot":"item","note":"collapsed ancestors"}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Mark the current page and keep it visible.
- Collapse gracefully when the trail is long.

**Don't**
- Use breadcrumbs for a flat structure.
- Link the current page to itself.
