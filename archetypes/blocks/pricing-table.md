# Pricing Table

## Intent

A pricing table lays out plans side by side so a visitor can compare what each
costs and includes, then choose. It makes differences legible at a glance,
highlights a recommended plan to guide the decision, and answers the practical
questions — price, billing period, and what's in each tier — that gate a purchase.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": true,
    "reflow": [
      {
        "at": "lg",
        "pattern": "reflow-columns",
        "note": "tiers step down in columns"
      },
      {
        "at": "md",
        "pattern": "horizontal-scroll",
        "note": "tiers scroll horizontally to keep them comparable"
      },
      {
        "at": "sm",
        "pattern": "stack",
        "note": "tiers stack, highlighting the featured plan"
      }
    ]
  },
  "props": [
    {"name":"interval","type":"enum","values":["monthly","yearly"],"default":"monthly","description":"Billing period toggle."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"plan","required":true},
    {"name":"feature","required":true}
  ],
  "events": ["onSelectPlan"],
  "states": ["default","highlighted"],
  "tokens": ["color.action.*"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Presenting two or more plans a visitor compares before selecting.

**Avoid when**
- There is a single plan/price — state it plainly.
- The full matrix would overwhelm before the summary — lead with plan cards.

## Anatomy

- **Billing toggle** (optional) — monthly/annual switch that updates all prices.
- **Plan columns/cards** (required) — name, price, short pitch, and a call to
  action per plan.
- **Recommended highlight** (optional) — a badge and emphasis on one plan.
- **Feature rows** (required) — a per-feature comparison (included, limited, or
  absent) across plans.
- **Footnotes** (optional) — caveats, limits, and definitions.

## States & behavior

- **Billing switch** — toggling monthly/annual updates prices and shows savings.
- **Recommended** — one plan emphasized to steer choice.
- **Per-plan CTA** — reflects state (start, upgrade, contact sales).
- **Currency/locale** (optional) — prices adapt.

## Variants

- **Cards** — plans as side-by-side cards with key features.
- **Matrix** — a full feature-by-plan table.
- **Cards + matrix** — summary cards above a detailed table.

## Layout & responsiveness

Plans sit in a row on wide screens with the recommended plan emphasized; they
stack into a single column on small screens, keeping the recommended plan
prominent. A full matrix scrolls horizontally or restructures per plan on narrow
widths.

## Accessibility

- **Semantics** — a real table with header associations (plans as columns,
  features as rows), or clearly-structured cards.
- **Billing toggle** — its effect on prices is announced.
- **Keyboard** — the toggle and every plan CTA are operable.
- **Non-color emphasis** — the recommended plan and included/excluded cells are
  distinguished by more than color.

## Content guidelines

- Make prices, billing period, and included features easy to compare.
- Keep feature rows parallel; define limits clearly.
- One specific CTA verb per plan.

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"card","slot":"plan"},
    {"ref":"badge","slot":"plan","note":"most popular"},
    {"ref":"button","slot":"plan","props":{"variant":"primary"}},
    {"ref":"switch","slot":"plan","note":"billing toggle"},
    {"ref":"toggle-group","slot":"plan","note":"billing toggle"},
    {"ref":"table","slot":"feature"}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Highlight a recommended plan honestly.
- Show billing period and real costs up front.

**Don't**
- Hide limits or fees, or use dark patterns to force a plan.
- Lead with an exhaustive matrix before a scannable summary.
