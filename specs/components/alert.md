# Alert

## Intent

An alert surfaces an important message in the flow of a page — a warning, a tip, a
success confirmation, or an error summary. Unlike a toast, it stays in place and
in context; unlike an alert-dialog, it doesn't interrupt or block the user.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": true,
    "reflow": [
      {
        "at": "sm",
        "pattern": "stack",
        "note": "trailing actions move below the message"
      }
    ]
  },
  "props": [
    {"name":"variant","type":"enum","values":["info","success","warning","danger"],"default":"info","description":"Severity."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"icon","required":false},
    {"name":"title","required":false},
    {"name":"description","required":true},
    {"name":"actions","required":false,"description":""}
  ],
  "a11y": {"role":"alert","announces":["message"]},
  "states": ["default"],
  "tokens": ["color.status.*","radius.md"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Communicating persistent, contextual status tied to a region or the page.
- Summarizing form errors or highlighting a condition users should notice.

**Avoid when**
- The message is transient confirmation — use a **toast**.
- The user must decide before continuing — use an **alert-dialog**.

## Anatomy

- **Icon** (optional) — reinforces severity.
- **Title** (optional) — short headline.
- **Message** (required) — the body text.
- **Actions** (optional) — links or buttons to resolve or learn more.
- **Dismiss** (optional) — close affordance for non-critical alerts.

## States & behavior

- **Severity** — info, success, warning, danger, each with a non-color cue.
- **Dismissible** — can be closed; critical alerts may persist.
- **Live** — an alert that appears in response to an event announces itself.

## Variants

- **Informational / success / warning / destructive**.
- **With actions** — remediation controls.
- **Banner** — full-width, page-level placement.

## Layout & responsiveness

Alerts span their container width, with icon, text, and actions aligned in a row
that wraps gracefully on small screens. Place them near what they concern (top of
a form, above a section).

## Accessibility

- **Semantics** — important, time-sensitive alerts use an assertive live role;
  advisory ones use a polite status. Severity is conveyed by text/icon, not color
  alone.
- **Screen reader** — dynamically shown alerts are announced without moving focus.
- **Keyboard** — any actions and the dismiss control are reachable and operable.

## Content guidelines

- Lead with what happened and what to do next.
- Keep severity vocabulary consistent with badges and toasts.

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"button","slot":"actions"},
    {"ref":"badge","slot":"icon"}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Match severity to real importance.
- Offer a clear next step where relevant.

**Don't**
- Overuse high-severity styling.
- Rely on color alone for meaning.
