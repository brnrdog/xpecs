# Sheet

## Intent

A sheet slides a panel in from an edge of the screen (commonly the side) to host
secondary content or a task while keeping the page context adjacent. It's roomier
than a popover and less interruptive than a centered dialog — ideal for details,
filters, or edit forms that relate to what's on screen.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": false,
    "minTarget": "44px",
    "reflow": [
      {
        "pattern": "fluid",
        "note": "the panel size tracks the viewport edge it's docked to"
      },
      {
        "at": "sm",
        "pattern": "to-sheet",
        "note": "an edge sheet becomes full-width"
      }
    ]
  },
  "props": [
    {"name":"open","type":"boolean","default":"false"},
    {"name":"side","type":"enum","values":["left","right","top","bottom"],"default":"right","description":"Edge it slides from."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"header","required":false},
    {"name":"body","required":true},
    {"name":"footer","required":false}
  ],
  "events": ["onOpenChange"],
  "a11y": {"role":"dialog","keyboard":["Tab","Escape"],"announces":["name"]},
  "states": ["closed","open"],
  "tokens": ["color.neutral.*","radius.lg"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Showing supplementary content or a task beside the current page (details,
  filters, quick edit).
- The content is taller than wide and benefits from an edge panel.

**Avoid when**
- The task demands full focus and centering — use a **dialog**.
- It's a mobile bottom, gesture-first panel — use a **drawer**.
- It's persistent primary navigation — use a **sidebar**.

## Anatomy

- **Overlay / scrim** (optional) — dims the page when modal.
- **Panel** (required) — slides from top/right/bottom/left.
- **Header** (required) — title and close.
- **Content** (required) — scrollable body.
- **Footer** (optional) — actions.

## States & behavior

- **Open / closed** — animated slide from the chosen edge.
- **Modal vs. non-modal** — blocks the page or leaves it usable.
- **Scrolling** — long content scrolls within the panel.
- **Dismiss** — close control, `Escape`, or scrim click.

## Variants

- **Right / left / top / bottom** placement.
- **Modal / non-modal**.
- **Sizes** — from a defined width/height scale.

## Layout & responsiveness

Anchored to an edge with a constrained size; content scrolls while header/footer
stay reachable. On small screens it may expand to full width or become a drawer.

## Accessibility

- **Semantics** — a dialog (modal when it blocks) with an accessible name.
- **Keyboard** — focus moves in on open, is trapped when modal, and returns on
  close; `Escape` closes.
- **Screen reader** — announces open/close and purpose; background inert when modal.
- **Motion** — respects reduced-motion.

## Content guidelines

- Give the sheet a clear title and a visible close.
- Keep it focused on content related to the current context.

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"scroll-area","slot":"body"},
    {"ref":"separator","slot":"footer"},
    {"ref":"button","slot":"footer","props":{"variant":"primary"}}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Manage focus and provide an explicit close.
- Choose the edge that fits the content shape.

**Don't**
- Use a modal sheet where the page must stay interactive.
- Confuse a task sheet with persistent navigation.
