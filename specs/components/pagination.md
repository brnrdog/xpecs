# Pagination

## Intent

Pagination breaks a long set of results into pages and gives users controls to
move among them. It bounds how much loads and renders at once, and lets users
orient themselves ("page 3 of 20") within a large collection.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": true,
    "minTarget": "44px",
    "reflow": [
      {
        "at": "sm",
        "pattern": "collapse-to-menu",
        "note": "middle page numbers collapse to an ellipsis; prev/next remain"
      }
    ]
  },
  "props": [
    {"name":"page","type":"number","default":"1","description":"Current page."},
    {"name":"total","type":"number","default":"1","description":"Total pages."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"control","required":true,"description":"Prev/next and page links."}
  ],
  "events": ["onPageChange"],
  "a11y": {"role":"navigation","keyboard":["Enter"],"announces":["current page"]},
  "states": ["default","disabled"],
  "tokens": ["color.neutral.*","radius.md"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- A result set is too large to show at once and discrete pages aid orientation.
- Users benefit from jumping to specific pages or knowing totals.

**Avoid when**
- Continuous browsing suits better — consider infinite scroll or "load more"
  (with their own trade-offs).
- The list is short enough to show fully.

## Anatomy

- **Previous / next** (required) — step controls, disabled at bounds.
- **Page numbers** (optional) — direct jumps, with ellipses for large ranges.
- **Current-page indicator** (required) — the active page.
- **Page size selector** (optional) — items per page.
- **Range/total summary** (optional) — "showing 21–40 of 320".

## States & behavior

- **At first / last page** — boundary controls disabled.
- **Active page** — clearly marked and non-interactive as a jump.
- **Truncation** — middle pages collapse into ellipses for long ranges.
- **Loading** — the region indicates fetching on page change.

## Variants

- **Numbered** — full page links with truncation.
- **Prev/next only** — minimal stepping.
- **Load more / infinite** — progressive loading (related pattern).

## Layout & responsiveness

A horizontal control group, centered or trailing. On narrow screens, reduce to
prev/next plus current indicator. Keep targets tappable and the current page
obvious.

## Accessibility

- **Semantics** — a navigation landmark labeled as pagination; the current page is
  marked; disabled controls are conveyed as such.
- **Keyboard** — all controls reachable and operable in order.
- **Screen reader** — announces page changes and current position (e.g. via a live
  region) so context isn't lost.

## Content guidelines

- Label controls clearly ("Previous page"); show totals when helpful.
- Keep page-size options sensible and few.

## Composition

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"ref":"button","slot":"control"},
    {"ref":"link","slot":"control"},
    {"ref":"select","slot":"control","note":"page size"}
  ]
}
```

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Indicate the current page and disable boundary controls.
- Announce page changes to assistive tech.

**Don't**
- Hide totals when users need to gauge scope.
- Make number targets too small on touch.
