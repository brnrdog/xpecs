# One-Time-Code Input

## Intent

A one-time-code input collects a short verification code (from SMS, email, or an
authenticator) with one visible slot per character. The segmented layout makes the
expected length obvious, eases review, and pairs naturally with auto-advance and
paste of the full code.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": false,
    "minTarget": "44px",
    "reflow": [
      {
        "at": "sm",
        "pattern": "wrap",
        "note": "cells wrap to a second row on very narrow screens"
      }
    ]
  },
  "props": [
    {"name":"length","type":"number","default":"6","description":"Number of code cells."},
    {"name":"value","type":"string","default":"","description":"Entered digits."},
    {"name":"disabled","type":"boolean","default":"false","description":"Not interactive."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"cell","required":true,"description":"A single-character entry box."}
  ],
  "events": ["onChange","onComplete"],
  "a11y": {"role":"group","keyboard":["ArrowLeft","ArrowRight","Backspace"],"announces":["value"]},
  "states": ["default","focus-visible","filled","disabled","error"],
  "tokens": ["color.action.*","radius.md"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Entering a fixed-length numeric or alphanumeric verification code.

**Avoid when**
- The value is free-form or variable length — use a plain **input**.
- A long secret is being entered — use a password input.

## Anatomy

- **Slots** (required) — one per character, fixed count.
- **Active-slot indicator** (required) — shows where input lands next.
- **Separator** (optional) — groups slots (e.g. 3-3).
- **Validation message** (conditional).

## States & behavior

- **Empty / partially filled / complete** — with the active slot highlighted.
- **Auto-advance** — typing moves focus forward; backspace moves back.
- **Paste** — pasting the full code distributes characters across slots.
- **Invalid** — wrong or expired code, with a clear message.
- **Disabled / loading** — during verification.

Completing the last slot may auto-submit.

## Variants

- **Numeric vs. alphanumeric**.
- **Grouped** — visual separators between segments.
- **Masked** — obscured characters for sensitive codes.

## Layout & responsiveness

Slots sit in a single row, evenly spaced, centered in their context. On mobile the
numeric variant surfaces a numeric keypad and integrates with OS code
auto-fill. Keep slots large enough to tap.

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard** — type, backspace, and arrow between slots; paste supported.
- **Semantics** — the control has a single accessible name describing the code;
  slots are not announced as separate meaningless fields.
- **Screen reader** — announces progress and the active position; errors are
  associated and announced.
- **Autofill** — supports platform one-time-code autofill where available.

## Content guidelines

- State where the code was sent and its length/expiry.
- Provide a resend affordance and clear expiry messaging.

## Composition

**Composed of:** Not applicable — a specialized primitive.

**Used by:** form, sign-in, dialog (verification steps).

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Support paste and OS autofill of the whole code.
- Auto-advance and allow easy correction.

**Don't**
- Force character-by-character typing without paste.
- Hide why a code was rejected.
