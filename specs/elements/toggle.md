# Toggle

## Intent

A toggle is a button that stays pressed or unpressed, representing an on/off state
for a formatting or view option — bold text, grid vs. list, mute. Unlike a switch
(a setting) it reads as a momentary tool that happens to remember its state, which
is why it lives naturally in toolbars.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": false,
    "minTarget": "44px",
    "reflow": []
  },
  "props": [
    {"name":"pressed","type":"boolean","default":"false","description":"Whether the toggle is on."},
    {"name":"disabled","type":"boolean","default":"false","description":"Not interactive."}
  ],
  "slots": [
    {"name":"label","required":true,"description":"Icon or text naming the state."}
  ],
  "events": ["onChange"],
  "a11y": {"role":"button","keyboard":["Enter","Space"],"announces":["pressed","disabled"]},
  "states": ["off","on","focus-visible","disabled"],
  "tokens": ["color.action.*","radius.md"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Turning a tool or view option on/off, especially in a toolbar (e.g. bold).

**Avoid when**
- Toggling a persistent setting in a form — use a **switch** or **checkbox**.
- Choosing one of several exclusive options — use a **toggle-group** or radios.

## Anatomy

- **Icon and/or label** (required) — what the toggle controls.
- **Container** (required) — the pressable target reflecting pressed state.

## States & behavior

- **Off (unpressed) / On (pressed)** — flips on activation.
- **Hover / focus / active** — with a visible focus indicator.
- **Disabled** — not interactive.

Activation flips the state on click and `Enter`/`Space`.

## Variants

- **Icon-only** — compact toolbar tool with an accessible name.
- **Icon + label** — clearer intent.
- **Sizes / emphasis** — from a defined scale.

## Layout & responsiveness

Toggles sit inline in toolbars with consistent sizing and spacing, often grouped.
Icon-only toggles must keep an adequate target size.

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard** — focusable; `Enter`/`Space` toggles.
- **Semantics** — button with a pressed state exposed (on/off).
- **Screen reader** — announces name and pressed/not-pressed.
- **Focus** — visible focus indicator; icon-only toggles have accessible names.

## Content guidelines

- Name the option the toggle controls; keep tooltips consistent with the name.

## Composition

**Composed of:** Not applicable — a primitive; composed into **toggle-group**.

**Used by:** toggle-group, toolbars, menubar.

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Expose the pressed state to assistive tech.
- Give icon-only toggles accessible names.

**Don't**
- Confuse a toggle (tool state) with a switch (setting).
