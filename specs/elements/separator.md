# Separator

## Intent

A separator divides content into distinct groups, giving structure and rhythm
without adding a heavier container. It clarifies where one set of items ends and
another begins.

## API

```json
{
  "responsive": {
    "container": true,
    "reflow": [
      {
        "pattern": "fluid",
        "note": "spans the full available length"
      }
    ]
  },
  "props": [
    {"name":"orientation","type":"enum","values":["horizontal","vertical"],"default":"horizontal","description":"Divider axis."}
  ],
  "a11y": {"role":"separator"},
  "states": ["default"],
  "tokens": ["color.neutral.*"]
}
```

## When to use / When not to use

**Use when**
- Grouping items within a menu, list, toolbar, or card.
- Providing a light visual break between sections.

**Avoid when**
- Whitespace alone already communicates the grouping.
- You need an interactive boundary — use a **resizable** handle.

## Anatomy

- **Line** (required) — horizontal or vertical rule.
- **Optional label** (optional) — a caption breaking the line (e.g. "OR").

## States & behavior

Separators are static. A labeled separator centers text within the rule. Decorative
separators carry no semantics; meaningful ones expose a separator role.

## Variants

- **Horizontal** — between stacked sections.
- **Vertical** — between inline items in a toolbar or nav.
- **Labeled** — divider with centered text.

## Layout & responsiveness

Horizontal separators span their container's content width; vertical separators
match the height of adjacent inline items. Orientation may switch when a layout
reflows from row to column.

## Accessibility

- **Semantics** — purely decorative separators are hidden from assistive tech;
  meaningful ones expose a separator role with orientation.
- **Screen reader** — does not announce redundant dividers.
- **Contrast** — as non-text, keep it perceivable without being loud.

## Content guidelines

- Use labeled separators sparingly; keep labels to a word or two.

## Composition

**Composed of:** Not applicable — a primitive element.

**Used by:** dropdown-menu, menubar, card, sidebar, navbar, lists.

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Prefer spacing first; add a separator when grouping needs reinforcing.
- Mark decorative separators as such.

**Don't**
- Stack multiple separators to create heavy borders.
