[@@@warning "-a"]

(* Icon — renders a named glyph from [Icons] as inline SVG. Color and weight are
   inherited from the surrounding text (stroke=currentColor), so an icon sits
   naturally beside a label. [size] maps to the optical size scale; pass [label]
   to give a meaningful icon an accessible name — omit it and the icon is
   treated as decorative and hidden from assistive tech.

   reativa's View layer creates nodes with [document.createElement] (HTML
   namespace), which can't produce a rendering [<svg>]; so the glyph is injected
   as [innerHTML] on a host [<span>] (see [Ui.set_inner_html_by_id]), which the
   browser parses in the SVG namespace and which still inherits [currentColor].
   Callers use it as a plain function: [Icon.make ~name:"check" ()].

   The host span is built inside a [View.dyn] region so the innerHTML is
   scheduled at *insert* time (with a fresh id) rather than at build time — an
   icon inside an initially-hidden region (e.g. a Newsletter success state) then
   still gets its markup when the region is first shown. *)
