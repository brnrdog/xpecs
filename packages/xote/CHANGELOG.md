# @prescriptive/xote

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f327773: Add a modern SVG icon library with an `Icon` component.

  - **`@prescriptive/xote`**: new `Icons` module — a curated outline icon set (50 glyphs)
    in the Feather / Lucide visual language (24×24 grid, no fill, 2px round
    strokes) — and an `Icon` element that renders a named glyph as an inline SVG.
    Icons inherit the surrounding text color and optical size; pass `label` for a
    meaningful icon (role=img + accessible name) or omit it to mark it decorative.
    Sizes: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`.
  - **`@prescriptive/xote`**: `Alert` now renders its `icon` as a glyph from the icon set
    (the prop takes an icon name) and shows a sensible per-variant default when none
    is given.
  - **`prescriptive`**: the `icon` element spec now types `size` as an enum and maps its
    implementation to `Icon.res`, so the component is compiler-checked against the
    contract.
